Day 3 (12/14/24):

The third day of working on the project has brought a lot of great things and I have gotten a lot done. Firstly I am happy to announce I did meet the goal I set for myself on day 2. I watched this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHr9jxKithk, which greatly described how object collision works in Pygame. I had it where in the game loop, if the player object collides with the food object, then the food x and y values would be randomized using the random module and redrawn on the screen. This worked great and made me feel thrilled as I was one step closer to finishing. The next thing I wanted to do was make a boundary as in snake if you bump into the boundaries of the game, the snake resets. I utilized the same tutorial I mentioned before and I drew 4 lines 5 pixels off the screen limit on all 4 sides. Now that I had 4 lines the tutorial showed that the '.clipline()' method accounts for if an object crosses or touches the line in which something will happen. The clip line method only takes one argument, and I had 4 separate lines, which would mean I needed 4 different 'if player.clipline()' lines. I sat there for a little bit, stumped because I felt like there had to be another way to go about it, as writing 4 lines of that felt very inefficient. After a while, I realized I could put the line objects into a list with a variable called lines and I could have a for loop in the game loop: 'for line in lines' and then draw each of the lines. This was a breakthrough for me and it worked great. This reminded me of when we open files we do lines = file.readlines() and then we can loop through those lines by using 'for line in lines'. Now that I had food that spawned in a random location every time the player touched it and boundaries that reset the snake's position to the starting position every time it touched a border it was time to move on to making the snake grow. For my future goal, I would like to have a baseline of how to grow the snake (maybe not fully functional) and also maybe a score system to keep track of how many times the snake eats a piece of food.
