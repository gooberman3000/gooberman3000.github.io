Thoughts and Tips for Programming Fundamentals

Reflecting on the course, I think the most important thing I learned was tackling a coding problem and knowing how and when to use certain data types, functions, and methods. Overall, I believe this course helped me deepen my understanding of Python and coding. Coding is a process that takes time, taking breaks and being patient with your code implementation is key to success. Early semester I thought the course wouldn't be too bad and would be like any other beginner coding class, but as the semester kept going the course challenged me not only to solve coding problems but to think about what was the most effective way of implementing it. It taught me to think critically in the context of code, and although we didn't get into coding games like I would have hoped to, I am proud to look back on the previous missions and training and say, 'I did that' (especially the int to English). My tip to incoming students is to not underestimate this course and to not be scared to ask questions if you are confused because this course builds on itself and if you don't have a strong base it won't go well. It has been a great privilege of this class.
