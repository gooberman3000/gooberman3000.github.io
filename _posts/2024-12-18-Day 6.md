Day 6 (12/18/24):

  Today is the final day of working on my project, I spent this day making minor tweaks to my code and changing my approach to how I checked for self-collision. After struggling all day yesterday on how to check if the head collided with the body I decided to take a different approach a sort of compromise. Instead of detecting if the head collided with one of the segments I decided to check if the head's x and y coordinates equaled any of the x and y coordinates of the segments. After testing out the code it did work if the head explicitly hit the body, but I do belive there could be some cases where the head clips the last segment and the snake won't reset (would be much appreciated if someone found a bug like this). After these 6 days of hard work, I am glad to look back on it and say it was all worth it, cause I am quite happy with what I have made. For future goals that I may do over break, I will figure out how I could put both the snake and food attributes into classes and also make the snake grow properly from end to end instead of overlapping squares. I am quite happy with the result I have made and this entire experience has been a great learning point. I think some points of improvement for my code would be improving the growing feature of the snake. As the snake grows the previous segment's left side aligns with the other segment's side, and I want to have it where the segments align end to end and follow the head dynamically. This overlapping also compromises my self-collision code because I have it where it detects if the head collides with the body, but when the head is overlapping with so many segments it's hard to detect when the head collides with the body. So both improving the growing feature and the self-collision will hugely improve my implementation and would conclude my work on this project.
