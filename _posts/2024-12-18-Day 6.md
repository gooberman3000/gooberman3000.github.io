Day 6 (12/18/24):

  Today is the final day of working on my project, I spent this day making minor tweaks to my code and changing my approach to how I checked for self-collision. After struggling all day yesterday on how to check if the head collided with the body I decided to take a different approach a sort of compromise. Instead of detecting if the head collided with one of the segments I decided to check if the head's x and y coordinates equaled any of the x and y coordinates of the segments. After testing out the code it did work if the head explicitly hit the body, but I do belive there could be some cases where the head clips the last segment and the snake won't reset (would be much appreciated if someone found a bug like this). After these 6 days of hard work, I am glad to look back on it and say it was all worth it, cause I am quite happy with what I have made. For future goal that I may do over break I will figure out how I could put both the snake and food attributes into classes and also make the snake grow properly from end to end instead of overlapping squares.

Here is the link to my Python snake file: [Snake](../files/snake_main.py)
